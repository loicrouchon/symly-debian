# Debian Symly

This repository holds the debian source packaging instructions for the [Symly](https://github.com/loicrouchon/symly/)
command line tool and publishes it to [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~loicrouchon/+archive/ubuntu/symly/+packages)

## Builds

Builds are triggered from the `v<x.y.z>` tags and the tag version must match the debian/changelog last version.
